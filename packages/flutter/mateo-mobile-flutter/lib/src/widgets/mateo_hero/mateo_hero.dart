/// A shared-element hero widget that animates visual state across screen
/// transitions.
///
/// Place a [MateoHero] on the source screen and a sibling with the same [tag]
/// on the destination screen. When the destination route is pushed — typically
/// via [MateoHeroPage] — the source element "flies" across to the destination
/// position while its appearance morphs between the source and destination
/// configuration. The source route stays composited underneath so the flight
/// is visible against the previous screen.
///
/// ## Flight lifecycle
///
/// Every hero flight goes through three phases:
///
///  1. **Departure** — the animation begins. The **departing** (source-on-push,
///     destination-on-pop) hero fires [onStart].
///  2. **Transition** — the flight shuttle interpolates between the source and
///     destination configurations. Content and layout switch from the departing
///     hero to the receiving hero at the midpoint of the animation.
///  3. **Settle** — the flight reaches its end value. The departing hero fires
///     [onEnd] and the **receiving** hero fires [onReceived].
///
/// The receiving hero is the one whose route becomes active after the
/// transition:
///  * On **push** — the destination (new route) receives the flight.
///  * On **pop** — the source (previous route) receives the flight.
///
/// All callbacks fire exactly once per flight, at the frame where the
/// animation settles.
///
/// ## Choosing a variant
///
/// Use one of the concrete subclasses directly:
///
///  * [MateoHeroText] — animates text content, [TextStyle], and wrapping
///    behavior. Text content and layout constraints switch at the flight
///    midpoint.
///  * [MateoHeroBackground] — animates a [BoxDecoration] (color, border radius,
///    gradient) and clips its child with the animated shape. Includes an
///    [MateoHeroEdgeFade] for content edges and supports width/height
///    interpolation.
///  * [MateoHeroGroup] — flies multiple heterogenous [MateoHero] instances as a
///    single shared element. Each child animates independently within the
///    group's layout.
///
/// ### Endpoint tags
///
/// Concrete subclasses provide a variant-specific default [tag] when none is
/// given. This keeps simple routes lightweight: one tagless [MateoHeroText],
/// one tagless [MateoHeroBackground], and one tagless [MateoHeroGroup] can
/// coexist on a route and each animates independently to its matching variant
/// on the destination. If a route has multiple active heroes of the same
/// tagless variant, Flutter asserts at navigation time — pass explicit tags
/// for those cases.
///
/// ### Nested heroes
///
/// A [MateoHeroBackground] can contain [MateoHeroText] or [MateoHeroGroup] children
/// that share a tag with counterparts on the destination. Each paired hero
/// animates independently during the same navigation, producing a layered
/// transition where the outer container flies while its inner text also
/// morphs.
///
/// ## Reduced motion
///
/// When [MediaQuery.disableAnimationsOf] returns `true`, [MateoHeroPage] sets
/// the route durations to [Duration.zero] and disables the [HeroMode]
/// entirely. No hero flight occurs and neither [onStart], [onEnd], nor
/// [onReceived] fire — the destination appears immediately with all content
/// visible.
///
/// ## Performance on low-end devices
///
/// Flight shuttles are wrapped in [RepaintBoundary] to isolate repaint work
/// during the transition. Decoration and text interpolation use
/// [Curves.easeOutCubic], a cost-effective easing curve that performs well on
/// low-end GPUs. Repaint work on the underlying routes does not affect the
/// flight's frame budget.
///
/// ```dart
/// // Source — a rounded card with a title and supporting text.
/// MateoHeroBackground(
///   tag: 'job-card',
///   decoration: BoxDecoration(
///     color: surfaceColor,
///     borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(38),
///   ),
///   child: Column(
///     children: [
///       MateoHeroText(
///         tag: 'job-title',
///         text: 'Garçom para Fim de Semana',
///         style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22, fontWeight: FontWeight.w700),
///       ),
///     ],
///   ),
/// )
///
/// // Destination — same tags animate the card and title independently
/// MateoHeroBackground(
///   tag: 'job-card',
///   decoration: BoxDecoration(color: bgColor),
///   child: Column(
///     children: [
///       MateoHeroText(
///         tag: 'job-title',
///         text: 'Garçom para Fim de Semana',
///         style: TextStyle(fontSize: 34, fontWeight: FontWeight.w700),
///       ),
///     ],
///   ),
/// )
/// ```

///  * [MateoHeroPage], the destination [Page] that enables transparent route
///    compositing and reduced-motion support.
///  * [MateoHeroExtension], the base class for reusable behaviors attached to
///    hero variants.
